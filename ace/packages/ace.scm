    (description
     "Dirseq is a calculates gene expression metrics, aimed particularly at
metatranscriptomic data mapped to population genomes.  DirSeq works out whether
RNAseq reads from metatranscriptomes are generally in the same direction as the
ORF predicted and provide gene-wise coverages using DNAseq mappings.")
